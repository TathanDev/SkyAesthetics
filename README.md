## What is Sky Aesthetics

Sky Aesthetics is an API that aims to simplify making changes to the Minecraft
sky. All you need to do is configure a file in your resourcepack. This means
that even resourcepack creators can change the sky!

## What can be made

Here are some possibilities you can do with the mod:

- Add any object in the sky
- Change or remove sun/moon texture
- Change sun/moon size
- Add more colorful stars
- Add moving stars
- Remove clouds
- Remove rain
- Change the color of the sky/sunset
- Add end-sky to your world
- Shootings Stars
- Constellations

## Shader compatibility

This mod is mostly compatible with shaders. However, all the stars and clouds
are handled by the shader so theses features will not work. You can find more
information about shaders on [the wiki](https://github.com/TathanDev/SkyAesthetics/wiki/Shaders-Compatibility).

## FAQ

**I installed the mod but nothing changed?**

This is normal as the mod is only an API. This means it by default changes nothing to the game. You need
to install resourcepacks for things to change.

**Damn, I found a bug!**

The mod is still in development, so bugs may happen. Please report them on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/TathanDev/SkyAesthetics/issues)!

**I want to indicate that my mod/resourcepack is use Sky Aesthetics. How ?**
