# Sky Aesthetics 1.21.4 

Well, There is not much to tell here...
I mean, I just updated the mod to 1.21.4. Cool right ?

But hey, you know, life is like a chocolate box, you never know what you are going to get.
No I'm just kidding, I just hate port mods to others versions, it's a pain

Time to sleep and not ruin my school life (Guess who has exams tomorrow ? ME !!!)
It's crazy how much a man can say weird things in this changelog, right ?
Btw, I have a girlfriend (Yea, I'm a modder and I have a girlfriend)

On this note, goodnight, good play and see you in the next update !

# Important Note
After writing this masterpiece, there is just a breaking changes :

- `color` of the sky color is now a Vector3, not a Vector4
